An informative website about the issue of colorism and its prominence within the cosmetic industry. A strong emphasis is placed on skin lightening products and the promotion of them to people of color. The phrase "Illusion of Inclusion" refers to the strategy of using light-skinned people of color in advertisements to lure in other people of color to try skin lightening products.
